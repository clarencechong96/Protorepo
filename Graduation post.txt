What appear like a long time of studies after which seems not very long now looking back. 
Took me 7 years plus to get my degree from when I first joined uni but I realized everyone is different. 
There are many ups and downs moment where I was so close in giving up, especially true during my final year as I was unwell. 
I am truly grateful to my parents and the friends who are there for me supporting me through my those times. 
I will not be where I am today without them!

******************
I wasn't the brightest nor the fastest among my peers but I want to thank God who has been blessed and assured me that I am able. 
Not in the slightest moment have I thought of achieving a High Achiever Award (1st Class), 
while being an average student who struggled to enter uni because of not meeting the minimum credit requirement. 
Therefore, I give Him all the glory and as I enter into the next season, there'll be more challenges ahead but I know it is going to be okay.

Also not forgetting to thank you guys for attending my graduation, makes this all the more special! üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
